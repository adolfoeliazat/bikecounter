# Project Roadmap
The project roadmap is a series of user stories describing the eventual functionality of the application. User stories will be marked with italics when they are added to the backlog, and with a strikethrough when they are implemented. Pull requests are happily accepted on this file, but they should reflect discussions about the roadmap in the issues queue.

[Bill's documentation](http://bikeandwalk.org/docs/)

1. As a SABA volunteer, I want to easily record bicycle traffic at a specified intersection so that data is usable by [SABA](http://sacbike.org/) and the [NBPD](http://bikepeddocumentation.org/).

   1.1 I want to specify an intersection by its cross streets.
   
   1.2 I want to record the weather during my count.

   1.3 I want to set a timer that will alert me when time has expired so that I know when I should stop counting.

   1.4 I want to record whether a cyclist is male or female.

   1.5 I want to record a cyclist's entry and exit points through the specified intersection.
   
   1.6 I want to record entry and exit points as a cardinal direction and a street (e.g. `South, 16th St. to North 16th St.` or `West, P St. to North 16th St.`)

   1.6 I want to record whether the cyclist was on the street or the sidewalk at both entry and exit points.

   1.7 I want to record 'packs' of cyclists.

2. As SABA, we want to be able to easily access and process data generated by bike count volunteers so that we can better understand how to make Sacramento more bike-friendly.
